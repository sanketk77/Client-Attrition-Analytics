# Customer Churn Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a financial institution (for bank) to identify patterns and predict churn likelihood. It leverages **SQL** for data extraction and preprocessing, **Python** for data analysis and machine learning, and **Tableau** for interactive visualizations. The goal is to provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

## Project Objectives
- Extract and preprocess customer data using SQL.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build predictive models using Python.
- Create interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize churn patterns and key metrics.
- Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For querying and preprocessing data from a relational database.
- **Python**: For data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Python Notebook**: For documenting Python analysis, model development, and SQL queries used for data extraction and preprocessing.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (any relational database will work for storing customer data).
